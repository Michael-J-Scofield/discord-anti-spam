  warnBuffer: 3, //Maximum amount of messages allowed to send in the interval time before getting warned.
  maxBuffer: 5, // Maximum amount of messages allowed to send in the interval time before getting banned.
  interval: 1000, // Amount of time in ms users can send a maximum of the maxBuffer variable before getting banned.
  warningMessage: "stop spamming or I'll whack your head off.", // Warning message send to the user indicating they are going to fast.
  banMessage: "has been banned for spamming, anyone else?", // Ban message, always tags the banned user in front of it.
