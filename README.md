const client = new Discord.Client();
const DiscordAntiSpam = require("discord-anti-spam");
const AntiSpam = new DiscordAntiSpam({

  warnThreshold: 3, // Amount of messages sent in a row that will cause a warning.
  banThreshold: 5, // Amount of messages sent in a row that will cause a ban
  maxInterval: 2000, // Amount of time (in ms) in which messages are cosidered spam. 
  warnMessage: "{@user}, Please stop spamming.", // Message will be sent in chat upon warning. 
  banMessage: "**{user_tag}** has been banned for spamming.", // Message will be sent in chat upon banning. 
  maxDuplicatesWarning: 7, // Amount of same messages sent that will be considered as duplicates that will cause a warning.
  maxDuplicatesBan: 10, // Amount of same messages sent that will be considered as duplicates that will cause a ban.
  deleteMessagesAfterBanForPastDays: 1, // Amount of days in which old messages will be deleted. (1-7)
  
  ignoredUsers: [], // array of ignored user ids
  ignoredGuilds: [], // array of ignored guild ids
  exemptUsers: (member) => member.user.createdTimestamp > 15552000000, // Bypass users if his account is more their 6 months old
  exemptRoles: (role) => role.name === "Moderator", // Bypass users if they have a role named "Moderator"
  exemptPermissions: ["MANAGE_MESSAGES", "ADMINISTRATOR", "MANAGE_GUILD", "BAN_MEMBERS"], // Bypass users with at least one of these permissions

  ignoreBots: true, // Ignore bot messages 
  verbose: false, // Extended Logs from module
  client: client, // Client is your Discord.Client and is a required option.
});

AntiSpam.on("warnEmit", (member) => console.log(`Attempt to warn ${member.user.tag}.`));
AntiSpam.on("warnAdd", (member) => console.log(`${member.user.tag} has been warned.`));
AntiSpam.on("banEmit", (member) => console.log(`Attempt to ban ${member.user.tag}.`));
AntiSpam.on("banAdd", (member) => console.log(`${member.user.tag} has been banned.`));
AntiSpam.on("dataReset", () => console.log("Module cache has been cleared."));

client.on("ready", () => console.log(`Logged in as ${client.user.tag}.`));

client.on("message", (msg) => {
  AntiSpam.message(msg);
});

client.login("YOUR_SUPER_SECRET_TOKEN");
```
